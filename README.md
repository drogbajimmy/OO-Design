## General info
Consider the following design problem and come up with a class hierarchy: Given a drawing mechanism, we always need to invoke some preprocessing before drawing, and postprocessing after drawing, and also each user will draw different shapes like circle, square, whatever he/she likes. Now, make an OO design of classes so that the routine preprocessing/postprocessing can be hidden, and the user can supply whatever the shape he/she wants to draw.
